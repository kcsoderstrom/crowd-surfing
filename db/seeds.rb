  "I'm a student outside of Chattanooga Tennessee, though I live in New Jersey on breaks and summers.. Just last year I spent the year in the middle of the Pacific ocean in Micronesia	on a little island called Pohnpei where I was taught how to properly spear fish and coconut tree climb to get a good meal. Being back in school, a slight damper has been put on my travels, but looking forward to working with a summer camp system in Alaska that will cover 3 different areas of what I hear to be a beautiful state.",
  "We are laid-back, curious, somewhat private, kind people who love to listen to stories of adventures (big and small) and make our own adventures. She loves to read; he does, too,	but it hurts his brain. He is an avid cyclist; she isn't, because it hurts her behind. We swear too much. We can both cook. We have three cats and are slightly untidy. She is super allergic to dogs but always carries Zyrtec and kleenex.",
  "When I am old I do not want to look back and say: What a boring life... Though after some age I think there comes a need to commit yourself to something. I think I am rather	tolerant and open-minded though I will not go out of my way to make friends with everybody. I greatly appreciate sense of humor. I am not very talkative, though I like discussions about things that matter in life (whatever that means), with a glass of red wine :)",
  "I love to travel and meet people from all around the world. The more I travel and converse, the more I see that we are really all the same. Talking to others from different backgrounds	just enlightens you to new perspectives and thus expands your own. One of the main reasons I travel is to write. I am a very spiritual and philosophical human being, and right now I am very into meditation. I am interested in just about everything, especially things that help make you a better person. I am very outgoing and love to have conversations, so I look forward to talking with you.",
  "I'm crazy about learning and exploring new places as much as I can. I like adventures and thrive on being challenged. I'm lots of fun fun fun.

  "I willfully decide to live in a world full of hope and promise even though sometimes REALITY may say otherwise.

I would remove all currency from being legally recognized and let the rest do its self. :) I know it sounds crazy but think about it.",

Between eating a bad meal and having a good experience and eating a good meal at a bad experience I will always go for the former; thats why I never try the same thing on the menu twice. Except for chile rieno's because they are so awesome. I have a fondness for cooking and the occasional nerdy boardgame.",

  "No machos or homophobics persons.If you're bi, gay or really gay friendly of course we'll have much more to share, correct?? I like all kinds of people, but I'm very choosy in	who I host.
